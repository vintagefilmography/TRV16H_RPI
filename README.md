The RPI with its camera replaces the old camera and reuses the old camera mount so once the  
covers are on you would not see any difference between the old and modified unit.  
The only noticeable difference is the two switches on the top replacing the color adjustment knobs.  
The switches are used to run the HDMI combined video and sound preview and record and exposure control.  
  
The unit comes equipped with the HDMI cable, AC cord and external USB connector for the USB stick.  
The video can be either saved to the external HDMI recorder, or internal memory and then transferred to the  
USB stick.  
  
The Unit also has a small wireless keyboard that provides access to full RPI functionality including the  
WiFi access from another computer on the local network.  
The camera full functionality can be controlled through the wireless keyboard or over the WiFi.
